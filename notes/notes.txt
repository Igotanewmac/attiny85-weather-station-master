I need to...

1. set the ALM1 flags to go off every second.

2. clear the alarm flag on startup.





So, in theory....

I can set ALM! for each second and ALM2 for each minute, by writing all zeros to their locations.


The alarm interrupt flag is enabled by default on power up.

have to switch the alarm enable bit to zero to enable the alarm.  this bit is set to zero when power is applied.

does "when power is applied" include the battery?
